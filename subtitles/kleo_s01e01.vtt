- Take it away.
- [Andi grunts]

179
00:13:12.958 --> 00:13:14.541
[sighs] What, are you pregnant?

180
00:13:19.041 --> 00:13:20.041
Yeah.

181
00:13:21.083 --> 00:13:22.083
You're joking, right?

182
00:13:22.625 --> 00:13:24.025
- What do you think?
- [Andi snorts]

183
00:13:24.791 --> 00:13:26.083
If you're not, then...

184
00:13:27.333 --> 00:13:29.166
No idea, then... [sharply inhales]

185
00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:30.666
I'd be a father, I imagine.

186
00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:32.958
[exhaling]

187
00:13:34.583 --> 00:13:39.083
Kleo, no messing about. Are you serious?

188
00:13:40.458 --> 00:13:41.458
- Hmm?
- [Kleo] Mmm.

189
00:13:44.541 --> 00:13:45.750
Are you not happy?

190
00:13:47.583 --> 00:13:50.791
- Well, of course I'm happy! [chuckling]
- [Kleo giggling]

191
00:13:50.875 --> 00:13:52.125
[Andi kissing Kleo]

192
00:13:52.208 --> 00:13:55.958
- [Kleo continues giggling]
- How long have you known?

193
00:13:56.041 --> 00:14:00.208
For 56 days, eight hours, and 52 seconds.

194
00:14:00.291 --> 00:14:02.666
- So long? And you didn't tell me?
- [Kleo chuckles]

195
00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:03.958
Girl or boy?

196
00:14:04.041 --> 00:14:06.333
She's a first-class agent, hopefully.

197
00:14:06.416 --> 00:14:10.750
[Andi] Well, these are...
[kisses]...enormous...

198
00:14:10.833 --> 00:14:14.208
[kisses]...footsteps... [kissing]
...with you as mama. [kisses]

199
00:14:14.291 --> 00:14:16.416
[Kleo chuckles]

200
00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:18.083
What will we do about the Firm?

201
00:14:18.916 --> 00:14:21.791
Somebody else will have to eliminate
the enemies of the state.

202
00:14:22.291 --> 00:14:24.333
Today was my very last mission.

203
00:14:24.833 --> 00:14:27.083
I'll go to the elite training centre,
figure skating.

204
00:14:27.166 --> 00:14:30.333
- That sounds good.
- My breasts will get really big.

205
00:14:31.083 --> 00:14:32.666
[Andi] Hmm!

206
00:14:37.333 --> 00:14:38.333
Show me.

207
00:14:42.083 --> 00:14:43.541
[Kleo laughing]

208
00:14:50.916 --> 00:14:52.208

210

211
00:15:09.833 --> 00:15:12.041
[muttering softly]

212
00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:16.375
[gasping and groaning]

213
00:15:18.541 --> 00:15:22.000
Am I seriously supposed to think
you've had a stroke or just dropped dead?

214
00:15:22.083 --> 00:15:24.250
Nah, a stroke.
I pretended to have a stroke...

215
00:15:24.333 --> 00:15:27.083
- God, Sven. What goes on in your head?
- [Sven groans]

216
00:15:27.166 --> 00:15:29.500
You tell me two days ago
you're going out for a beer,

217
00:15:29.583 --> 00:15:33.500
you only come home now, without calling,
without letting me know in any way.

218
00:15:33.583 --> 00:15:35.291
- Hey, I've been worried.
- [Sven] Yeah.

219
00:15:35.375 --> 00:15:38.291
Well, in my version,
I'd have made you breakfast

220
00:15:38.375 --> 00:15:41.083
with coffee and rolls
and eggs and all that shit.

221
00:15:41.166 --> 00:15:42.583
Hadn't we agreed to call?

222
00:15:43.166 --> 00:15:44.250
We had.

223
00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:45.958
I'm really sorry.

224
00:15:46.666 --> 00:15:47.666
Really.

225
00:15:48.208 --> 00:15:50.291
But something completely crazy happened.

226
00:15:50.375 --> 00:15:51.458
You won't believe it.

227
00:15:51.541 --> 00:15:56.500
A murder in the Big Eden.
And who witnessed it? I did.

228
00:15:58.125 --> 00:15:59.625
[paper rustling]

229
00:15:59.708 --> 00:16:00.708
It's a chance.

230
00:16:01.916 --> 00:16:03.000
[zip closing]

231
00:16:03.625 --> 00:16:05.416
This is my chance.

232
00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:07.250
[footsteps approaching]

233
00:16:07.333 --> 00:16:08.458
[woman] Hmm.

234
00:16:09.625 --> 00:16:10.625
[son] Hi, Dad.

235
00:16:11.125 --> 00:16:12.625
[Sven moans affectionately]

236
00:16:12.708 --> 00:16:13.541
[son] Oh God.

237
00:16:13.625 --> 00:16:16.375
[Sven] What? What is it?

238
00:16:16.458 --> 00:16:18.333
- [son] Dad, you stink.
- [Sven] <i>You</i> stink.

239
00:16:18.416 --> 00:16:19.583
[son groans]

240
00:16:21.208 --> 00:16:22.208
This is great.

241
00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:24.833
- [calm, curious music playing]
- [Sven chuckles]

242
00:16:24.916 --> 00:16:28.291
[woman] Do you know what's great?
Sleep is great.

243
00:16:29.666 --> 00:16:31.375
Sven, come to bed now.

244
00:16:36.375 --> 00:16:38.041
[music intensifies]

245
00:16:40.083 --> 00:16:41.416

247
00:16:45.208 --> 00:16:47.125
- [Sven] Morning.
- [officer] Morning, Petzold.

248
00:16:47.916 --> 00:16:49.125
Got to be time for that.

249
00:16:49.875 --> 00:16:51.875
[indistinct chattering]

[music stops]

252
00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:01.583
Svenny,

253
00:17:01.666 --> 00:17:04.208
all day yesterday, I didn't call her once,
just like you said.

254
00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:05.290
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

255
00:17:05.375 --> 00:17:06.290
Super, Freddy.

256
00:17:06.375 --> 00:17:08.165
Yeah, but I called five times
in the night.

257
00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:09.958
We got totally wasted at Diener's.

258
00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:13.250
I went off on one into the machine.
"Oh, you're so cool, you're so cool."

259
00:17:13.333 --> 00:17:14.625
The sixth time, she answered.

260
00:17:14.708 --> 00:17:17.290
She didn't think it was cool.
Thanks. [sniffs]

261
00:17:17.375 --> 00:17:21.083
Hey, seriously, I don't think
she's such a bombshell, your Natalie.

262
00:17:22.415 --> 00:17:25.375
She's a bit trendy-schmendy, right?

263
00:17:25.458 --> 00:17:28.375
Easy for you, mate.
You've got Jenny. Not everyone's so lucky.

264
00:17:28.458 --> 00:17:31.791
What's this, "lucky"?
I'm the extremely horny type.

265
00:17:31.875 --> 00:17:33.458
[chuckles] The extremely horny type?

266
00:17:33.541 --> 00:17:36.333
- What am I then, a bum?
- [chuckling] Come on, let's go shopping.

267
00:17:36.416 --> 00:17:38.875
We'll sort out your hairstyle,
get you a great car.

268
00:17:38.958 --> 00:17:41.278
- Are you just taking the piss, or what?
- [Sven chuckling]

269
00:17:41.333 --> 00:17:42.500
Hey.

270
00:17:44.166 --> 00:17:46.791
Soon you can tell
your girly stories to someone else.

271
00:17:46.875 --> 00:17:49.250
- How's that, then?
- Last night I went to Eden.

272
00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:51.958
Eden? Where the murder happened?

273
00:17:52.041 --> 00:17:54.000
Exactly. And I got to see the suspect.

274
00:17:54.791 --> 00:17:57.625
Here. This sketch was drawn
from my description.

275
00:17:57.708 --> 00:18:00.000
What the hell's that?
She looks like a ten-year-old kid.

276
00:18:00.083 --> 00:18:02.750
You're talking a load of shite.
Do you know what this all means?

277
00:18:02.833 --> 00:18:03.666
What's that?

278
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:06.250
- I am gonna solve this case.
- [intriguing music playing]

279
00:18:06.333 --> 00:18:09.458
[Freddy] You're gonna solve this case?
What's wrong with you?

280
00:18:09.541 --> 00:18:10.861
- I'm telling you...
- Wait a sec.

281
00:18:10.916 --> 00:18:12.250
Sven. Svenny?

282
00:18:12.333 --> 00:18:14.958
[intriguing music continues]

283
00:18:15.916 --> 00:18:20.291
Hello, Mr. Böttger.
Any news in the Eden case? The girl?

284
00:18:20.791 --> 00:18:22.958
- Just to hear what the status is.
- [Böttger laughs]

285
00:18:23.041 --> 00:18:25.166
Oh yeah, right, your work of art.

286
00:18:25.666 --> 00:18:27.250
Michalzik told me about it.

287
00:18:27.333 --> 00:18:29.666
I'm afraid not,
despite a major search for them.

288
00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:31.230
She must have vanished into thin air.

289
00:18:31.291 --> 00:18:35.000
Well, when your colleagues
need any assistance,

290
00:18:35.625 --> 00:18:36.958
any time, I'm here.

291
00:18:37.041 --> 00:18:37.916
Huh?

292
00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.375
Before you go offering assistance,

293
00:18:39.458 --> 00:18:42.125
first you ought
to do your own job properly, Petzold!

296
00:18:52.541 --> 00:18:54.341
[officer] This was intercepted
by our resident

297
00:18:54.375 --> 00:18:56.791

law enforcement authorities.

298
00:18:56.875 --> 00:18:58.666

- Yes. A very great honour.
- [Kleo] Hmm.

- He came specially to congratulate me.

Grandpa, I know you already have one,
but this one is stereo, and it's got bass.

323
00:20:12.125 --> 00:20:15.958
And you enjoy listening to music so much,
so I thought you'd like it.

324
00:20:16.041 --> 00:20:18.500
Turn the thing on then.
I've no idea how it works.

FOOTBRIDGE TO MÄRKISCHE - ALLEE

350
00:21:44.458 --> 00:21:45.625
[Kleo grunting]

351
00:21:47.541 --> 00:21:50.500
- Watch where you're going there, miss.
- Yeah. I'm sorry.

352
00:21:51.375 --> 00:21:52.583
[man sneers]

353
00:21:52.666 --> 00:21:54.458
[engine revving]

354
00:21:55.708 --> 00:21:58.041
Yes, and then I went
to the disco by myself, you know?

355
00:21:58.125 --> 00:21:59.041
[Kleo] Yeah.

356
00:21:59.125 --> 00:22:02.833
I thought I'd just take a look,
and then, uh, I... Marco came up to me.

357
00:22:02.916 --> 00:22:06.375
- [Kleo] Marco? [chuckles]
- Yeah, Marco from Fangschleuse.

358
00:22:06.458 --> 00:22:07.916
And then we danced for a bit,

359
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.166
we had another drink,
and it was really cool.

360
00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:13.791
And then he said he works at the WBD,
the Wilthen brandy distillery.

361
00:22:13.875 --> 00:22:14.708
[Kleo] Mm-hmm.

362
00:22:14.791 --> 00:22:17.250
So I said, "Hey, watch out
that you don't become an alcoholic

363
00:22:17.333 --> 00:22:19.875
if you've got the stuff
on tap all day long." You see?

364
00:22:19.958 --> 00:22:22.250
And then he says quite seriously...

365
00:22:22.333 --> 00:22:25.750
[mocking]..."I've drunk this for years.
If I was an alcoholic, I'd know it."

366
00:22:25.833 --> 00:22:27.500
Oh wonderful! I mean, can you believe it?

367
00:22:27.583 --> 00:22:29.416
- [woman] Ms. Straub?
- Yeah?

368
00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:31.625
We have to ask you to come along with us.

369
00:22:31.708 --> 00:22:32.708
And you are?

370
00:22:33.041 --> 00:22:33.875
What's all this?

371
00:22:33.958 --> 00:22:35.458
You've been reported.

372
00:22:35.958 --> 00:22:39.458
It must be a misunderstanding.
My name is Kleo Straub.

373
00:22:39.541 --> 00:22:43.083
- [woman] Come with us, please.
- [ominous music playing]

374
00:22:45.458 --> 00:22:46.666
- Come on.
- [Kleo sighs]

375
00:22:47.583 --> 00:22:51.250
Kleo, what should I tell them?
Should I say you've been arrested?

376
00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:53.550
- It'll be cleared up soon.
- [woman] Come on.

377
00:22:53.583 --> 00:22:54.958
[ominous music continues]

378
00:22:57.208 --> 00:22:58.583
[handcuffs clinking]

379
00:22:58.666 --> 00:23:00.250
[typewriter clacking]

380
00:23:00.916 --> 00:23:04.083
[investigator] Ms. Straub,
you're accused of betraying state secrets.

381
00:23:04.166 --> 00:23:07.708
You handed over the blueprints
of the Sternradio cassette recorder

382
00:23:07.791 --> 00:23:11.583
SKR 800 Mir
to a representative of the class enemy.

383
00:23:11.666 --> 00:23:13.250
That's... that's ridiculous.

384
00:23:13.333 --> 00:23:16.208
You currently work
for Sternradio Entertainment Electronics.

385
00:23:16.291 --> 00:23:18.416
That's right. In production.

386
00:23:19.125 --> 00:23:20.666
Will you explain this then?

387
00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:24.708
- [ominous music playing]
- [typewriter clacking in the background]

388
00:23:24.791 --> 00:23:26.458
I just bumped accidentally into this man.

389
00:23:26.541 --> 00:23:30.250
This man is an enemy agent
from West Germany.

390
00:23:30.333 --> 00:23:32.791
He was detained at the border
shortly after this.

391
00:23:32.875 --> 00:23:37.083
Why don't you call Reconnaissance,
Division 18. They'll clear this all up.

392
00:23:38.125 --> 00:23:40.416
It was your grandfather
who looked after you?

393
00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:41.916
[Kleo] That's right.

394
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.625
And my grandfather works
for Reconnaissance, Division One. Ask him.

395
00:23:46.125 --> 00:23:48.250
Well, there is no mention of anyone in

396
00:23:48.333 --> 00:23:52.375
the Ministry of State Security's records
with the name Kleo Straub.

397
00:23:52.458 --> 00:23:54.098
Are you lying for your own personal gain?

398
00:23:54.125 --> 00:23:55.583
- [angrily] No!
- Hmm.

399
00:23:56.541 --> 00:24:00.750
I'm an unofficial agent of the state!
Reconnaissance, Division 18.

400
00:24:01.916 --> 00:24:04.041
I took part in 12 successful operations.

401
00:24:04.125 --> 00:24:07.541
There are records of all of them.
Call my commanding officer.

402
00:24:08.458 --> 00:24:09.958
Don't worry, we will do that.

403
00:24:10.458 --> 00:24:12.625

...the accused, Kleo Jennifer Straub,
born on September the 2nd, 1964,

411
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:41.000
is sentenced to life imprisonment
for high treason and espionage

412
00:24:41.083 --> 00:24:43.666
due to the particular severity
of this case.

413
00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:47.000
[typewriter continues clacking]

414
00:24:47.875 --> 00:24:51.000
I demand that my witnesses be heard here.

415
00:24:51.083 --> 00:24:53.333
[judge] They've all
been questioned already, Ms. Straub.

416
00:24:53.416 --> 00:24:56.166
And they told you exactly who I work for.

417
00:24:57.208 --> 00:24:59.958
All the witnesses testified against you.

418
00:25:00.041 --> 00:25:01.916
Your colleagues at Sternradio,

419
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.333
Comrade Uwe Mittig,
Colonel Wieczorek, even your grandfather.

420
00:25:05.416 --> 00:25:07.291
[shouting] That cannot have happened!

421
00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:09.958
I want to see the records.

422
00:25:11.958 --> 00:25:13.833
I demand access to the files!

423

I... I... I...

I'm having a child.

426
00:25:19.958 --> 00:25:23.125
Well, you really should have thought
about that before, Ms. Straub.

427
00:25:23.208 --> 00:25:25.833
- [laughing desperately]
- Take the prisoner away, please.

428
00:25:25.916 --> 00:25:26.916
This is a joke.

429
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.375
This... [exhales sharply] This is a joke.

430
00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.000

Well, the guy died of an overdose,
so, not murder.

Ah, but the woman had a knife,
here on her leg.

Who takes a knife
with them to a fucking disco, huh?

478
00:28:22.041 --> 00:28:23.881
That would be a clue
if the guy'd been stabbed.

But was he stabbed? I don't think so.

Right, right, but there is a victim.
Who... Who's the victim?

Hasn't been identified.

- And the woman?

483
00:28:34.833 --> 00:28:36.458
Have they questioned the woman?

Yeah, yeah, um... um...
[clears throat] No, um...

485

And, um... [clears throat]...try the curry.

She doesn't exist?
Are they taking the piss?

Of course this woman exists!
Are you listening?

489
00:28:47.791 --> 00:28:49.583
I witnessed it. I was right there.

490
00:28:49.666 --> 00:28:52.083
But you were also wasted.
You said so yourself, hmm?

491

What's that got to do with anything?
The woman was still there.

Hmm, Petzold... [clears throat]
...listen, you're Fraud, not Homicide.

499
00:29:18.708 --> 00:29:21.125
He's saying he died of an overdose.
Case closed.

500
00:29:21.625 --> 00:29:24.541
I'm telling you this guy didn't die
of a fucking overdose, seriously.

501
00:29:24.625 --> 00:29:27.083
The woman killed him.
A hundred percent, a thousand percent.

Do you want some fries with this, or erm...

You know how it worked.

for the Firm all along.

- [Straub] That would have been treason.

757

- [Straub] Yes. Good. Do it.

762
00:45:31.666 --> 00:45:36.458

No.
